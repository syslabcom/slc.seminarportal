Detailed Documentation
**********************

slc.seminarportal can be used to model and present seminars and
conferences.

When you view a seminar, you will be presented with a roster showing all
the rooms (venues) and the speeches held in those rooms. The roster is a
table with the rooms as the columns and the times of the speeches as the
rows.

To show a column with the speech times on the roster, make sure to check the
box on the bottom of the seminar edit page.

Content Types:
--------------

The following content types are available: 

* Seminar
    The Seminar is globally addable and contains all the seminar-related 
    subobjets.


* Speakers Folder
    The Speakers folder is automatically created whenever a seminar has been 
    created. This folder's allowed content types are restricted to speakers 
    only.


* Speaker
    Every conference and seminar has people holding talks, making presentations 
    and giving speeches. These people are modeled with the speaker content type. 
    You can add references to speeches (i.e the speeches held by this speaker). 
    These references are two-way, so the speeches now also have references to this 
    speaker. 
    

* Speech Venues Folder
    The Speech Venues folder is also automatically created when a seminar is 
    created. This folder's allowed content types are restricted to speech venues 
    only.


* Speech Venue
    A speech venue refers to the room or conference hall in which speeches are held. 
    This folder's allowed content types are restricted to speeches only.


* Speech
    A speech is a talk or presentation held at the conference and in one of the 
    rooms/venues. You can add references to speakers (i.e the speakers who held 
    the speech). These references are two-way, so the speakers now also have 
    references to the speeches.

Other features:
You can add a 'layout' property on the folder containing your seminars.
Give the value of '@@seminarfolder-view' and you will have now a special
view for your seminars with simple and advanced search options.

Dummy Data:
-----------

If you want to get an impression of the structure, views and content types provided by
slc.seminarportal, then you can create some dummy seminars, speakers and
speeches with a provided external method.

In the Zope management interface, create a new external method by choosing it
from the dropdown box.

Then give the following values:
    - id: create_seminar_test_data (or whatever you prefer)
    - Title: (whatever you prefer)
    - Module Name: slc.seminarportal.create_seminar_test_data
    - Function Name: run

After saving, click on the 'test' tab and wait for the external method to
finish executing. 

You should now have a 'Seminars' folder with dummy data in your Plone root.
