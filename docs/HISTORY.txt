1.2.15 (2010-08-25)
-------------------

- In "Featured speakers" portlet, I replaced field name "speakers" with 
  "featured_speakers". Reason: in a seminar, we also have a folder called
  "speakers". The code in zope.app.form.browser.itemswidget.OrderedMultiSelectWidget
  in selected() tries to get all values for the field by checking if self.context
  .context has an attr named like the field -> the SPSpeakers folder is found,
  and mayhem follows (= cannot add the portlet inside a seminar) [thomasw]
- add path to _render_cachekey of speakers portlet; make it possible to have more
  than one in the site [thomasw]
- Hide "Add new XXX" buttons for anonymous on speeches, speakers and speech-
  venues folders [thomasw]
- corrected a typo in the GS for Speech FTI, wrong view name [thomasw]

-------------------

- Fixed a bug in the speakers portlet, for the case when less speakers were

  users [thomasw]
